hey Hi I want to prepare my CV I'm working Infosys as asn Associate Buisness analyst post I'm a GIS or Python Developer - Past 7 moth I joined Infosys I'm working PG&E California in Geomart section - so write what I can write in my cv - I'm working mostly Cloud part as well as Scripting in Automation - Daily Jobs - ArcGIS Add In creation - Geomart Task Manager Improvement - That will pass ats score an dipressive a


here is the brief discussion about Geomart
GeoMart is a platform that makes PG&E geospatial data and functionality available to other systems and applications. 
It is comprised of different components that are architected to meet varying client needs, including internal, external (authenticated), and fully public data needs.
There is actually no such thing as "GeoMart data." GeoMart is a centralized hub that receives LOB GIS data from the asset LOB systems of record and makes the data available to consumers without impacting performance or stability of the Foundational systems.
Within GeoMart the data are handled and served out with attention to geospatial best practices and standards.
The content is made available via various scalable, repeatable, and stable mechanisms including API's, streaming services, and ETL.

Geomart Task Manager (GTM)
Created by Narasimhan, Kumar, last modified on Jul 29, 2019
The Geomart Task Manager (GTM) is essentially a task scheduler with advanced capabilities:

Load-balanced grid computing
Automatic task partitioning & reporting


GTM Components:
The Database
Web/REST Services (WCF)
Windows Service
Web Portal
ExecuteTask - a command line utility to execute tasks

 

Code - currently in TFS, expected to migrate to Github soon.
 

 

The Database
The oracle DB has one & only one point of contact - the WCF.  All windows services, the web portal and the ExecuteTask (a command line tool) access the database via the WCF.  



The WCF

The WCF provides most necessary services to talk to the DB.  Of these only some are RESTful.  A token is needed to communicate with the WCF for several services. (see DB)

QA: http://qaetappiiswc007/GTMWcf/GMService.svc
Prod: http://pretappiiswc006/GTMWcf/GMService.svc

Windows Service
 It is essential that the windows service be configured for a automatic "delayed start" with recovery options of restarting the service for all attempts with a 10 minute interval.  The windows service may be set to restart periodically (based on a Setting) - this is to address memory leaks (if any). The restart will only occur if the system is idle.

Web Portal

QA: http://qaetappiiswc007/GTMWEB/home/Activity3
Prod: http://pretappiiswc006/GTMWeb/home/Activity3


Servers
Clicking on a server will show its server roles at the bottom of the page. You may add new server roles to the selected server.
Version is the GTM windows service version on the host.  The global setting MIN_APP_VERSION controls the minimum allowed version.  This is useful when a graceful service upgrade is desired.  Raising the minimum allowed version simply disallows servers with lower versions from picking up new tasks from the queue. This allows for existing tasks to complete.  Admins may then upgrade when the process count (see servers tab) shows zero utilization.
DBlog  0=no logging on DB, 6 = log everything including diagnostics
Locallog  (logs into {APP_LOG_FOLDER})  0 = no local log, 6 = log everything including diagnostics

Tasks, Subtasks, Schedule and Queue
Task
A task is specified by its
Name - unique name
Server role - null (all enabled servers) or a specific server role (Note: you can create new server roles in the Settings page)
Priority -  (integer) higher the number, higher the priority.  A change will apply immediately to pending items in the queue. A higher priority may be desired if the task is critical and it does not take too long to execute. A higher priority will ensure the task

here is the brief of esri add in that I created Patch Location Tool 


herer is the background 

Sorry to interrupt. So I'll just add some background to this tool.
Sheela Dhattappa Gawi 0 minutes 14 seconds
I think what I might be already familiar since I've discussed multiple times.
Sheela Dhattappa Gawi 0 minutes 18 seconds
So the patch location data I think the TNP is processing the patch location data.
Sheela Dhattappa Gawi 0 minutes 24 seconds
They're sending it to GIS.
Sheela Dhattappa Gawi 0 minutes 27 seconds
As of now, the current TNP job is already handling the updates and deletes, I guess, whereas the create patch location is not handled through the automated jobs, so there used to be an e-mail communication to all the mappers, including Mike.
Sheela Dhattappa Gawi 0 minutes 47 seconds
So they used to manually go pick up a patch location, lat long value.
Sheela Dhattappa Gawi 0 minutes 52 seconds
Go and place the corresponding side code value over there. So in order to ease up this process, we came up with this approach of PL Palcement tool.

We are gettaging tht data from the TNp trascation - because they are capturing all the trascation sent to gis there is the table fogis Int user schema - tnp patch location data table form the table we are picking only creat trasaction then we rae checking those site core alredy processed gis or not - for patch location site core always uniwue - if the site core alrey presenyt in ourt databse that mesna it's aredy palced by user - so we dont want any diplicate -thoise site core not process that we are showing in select pane arcmap to user - attribute data - and lat long value we are showing to sueer
